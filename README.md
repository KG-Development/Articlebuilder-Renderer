# Articlebuilder-Renderer

A fully self-written editor for building Articles and/or Webpages in a web-based sandbox. 
The Parts are stored in JSON format and can be interpreted by our renderer.
Ported so far:

- Full support of drag-and-drop to insert elements
- you can style any given element at your imagination
- you can save every article (with a title + description) which will be stored in localstorage (normally in a database, but this is in the responsibility of the user
- there's a section sample news where you can see our renderer in action and see your created news

To be ported:

- Possibility of upload and download of any file (probably with local storage as this project doesn't have any backend)
- the deleting and showing of currently or lately edited articles
